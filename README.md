## Advent of Code 2021 solutions

These are my solutions for AoC 2021.

### About me

- I'm a seldom experienced programmer from Kyiv, Ukraine.
- My favorite languages: Rust, Elixir, Haskell.
- I never completed an AoC in full. Furthest I got was 10\* (6 days) in AoC 2020.

### Plan

This year, I'm going to:

- [x] experiment with [Zig](./zig) for the first time ever
- [ ] further my knowledge of [Go](./go) besides code katas (kudos to [Exercism](https://exercism.org)!)
- [ ] use [Rust](./rust) to 100% it, because _cough_ it's the best language ever _cough_
- maybe something else?

### License

This shouldn't be licensed. But, just in case: [Unlicense](LICENSE.md).
